## Installing Requirements

This project is built for Django 1.9. However Django 2.0 is easier to install and seems to be working fine.

To install Django use `pip install django`.

## Starting from the Terminal

In case you want to run your Django application from the terminal just run:

`$ python2 manage.py runserver localhost:8080`
    
## Configuration

You can configure your Python version and `PYTHONPATH` used in
Cloud9 > Preferences > Project Settings > Language Support.

## Support & Documentation

Django docs can be found at https://www.djangoproject.com/

You may also want to follow the Django tutorial to create your first application:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/

Visit http://docs.c9.io for support, or to learn more about using Cloud9 IDE.

## Max's notes
PHPmyadmin lives at https://woofer-feman.c9users.io/phpmyadmin/
hit me up for a login

## Cole's notes
When pushing to github from the Cloud9 terminal,
switch to your own github username with the command:
    
git config user.name "putYourUserNameHere"

Otherwise commits will not be under your name.

To access the admin site use  username admin and password KN8uNrwKFQGk.
